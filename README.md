## How It's Built

Here's a quick glimpse at some of the technology used in building this app.

This app is built with latest [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) v7 (7.5.1 at time of writing).

Since it's "serverless", the app only uses the "web" *side* (not the GraphQL "api" *side*).

### Frontend (React, etc)

Redwood currently uses [React library](https://react.dev/) v18 (18.2.0 at time of writing). The approach used for React is functional components with basic hooks for state management.
